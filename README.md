# Doctor Website (Figma to Code) 🚀

This is the result of developing a figma challenge model. The main problem I encountered here was the exact reproduction of the sizes presented on the model and the use of resources because as I was coding with React + Tailwind it was not easy to find exactly the same sizes.

## React + TypeScript + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

## Requirements ❗

- Node (>14 recommended) + npm
